# Overcharge
Overcharge is one of the stats in the HentaiVerse. It is represented by yellow pips on the player's health bar, wherein each pip is equal to 25% overcharge.
Players can activate their Spirit Stance with 50% or more Overcharge.
Weapon & Special Skills require Overcharge.
Gaining Overcharge
All players have a cap of 250% Overcharge.
Successfully hitting an enemy with a physical attack fills the player's Overcharge bar by a 5-10%.
A successful Counter-Attack will give 5-10% of overcharge.
Fighting Style, offhand hits, and domino strikes do not matter


# Spirit Stance
Spirit Stance (also known as Spirit Channeling and Spirit Mode) is available to all players and allows for increased physical damage output and decreased mana cost at the cost of Overcharge and Spirit Points.
Can be successfully toggled once a player has at least 50% Overcharge.
Can be disabled at any time.
When toggled, physical damage is boosted by +100% and mana cost is reduced by 25%.
The reduced mana cost count towards Innate Arcana's upkeep.
Spirit Stance consumes one point of Spirit and 10% overcharge per round.
This cost is not subtracted on the turn that it is activated but is subtracted on the turn it is toggled off should the player do so.
Will automatically become "exhausted" and deactivate if the player falls below these requirements.
Note that the turn during which Spirit Stance is triggered that battle regen will not occur.
